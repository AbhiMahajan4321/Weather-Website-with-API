# Weather-Website-with-API
A simple weather website built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that uses the OpenWeather API to fetch real-time weather data for any city. It shows temperature in Celsius, humidity, a short description, and a matching emoji. Includes error handling and a clean, responsive design for a smooth user experience.


This project is a weather website developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
It uses the OpenWeather API to fetch real-time weather data for any city entered by the user, displays the details on screen, and shows an emoji matching the weather conditions.

# Features
- Fetches live weather data using the OpenWeather API.
- Displays city name, temperature in Celsius, humidity, and weather description.
- Shows a weather emoji that matches the current conditions.
- Handles errors for invalid or empty city inputs.
- Clean, responsive, and user-friendly interface.
- Simple and readable design with styled components.

# How It Works
1. The user enters a city name in the input field.
2. A request is sent to the OpenWeather API to fetch live weather data.
3. The response provides temperature, humidity, description, and weather condition codes.
4. The site updates the display with:
   - City name and weather details.
   - Temperature converted from Kelvin to Celsius.
   - A weather emoji selected based on condition codes.
5. If an error occurs (e.g., invalid city), an error message is shown instead of the weather data.
